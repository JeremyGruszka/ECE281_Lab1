### Analysis
After creating a truth table, K maps, and schematics, I ran digital tests using Xilinx ISE and iSim.  I ran the tests in such a way that when a specific set of inputs were put forth, the corresponding outputs were displayed.  When comparing my truth table and the testbench analysis, the outcomes (X, Y, and Z) for each set of inputs was the same in both my truth table and the simulation results.  This shows that the simulation was successful, and that my truth table, K maps, and schematics were correct.
